# Users on Ubuntu

## 1. What is a User?

A **user** is like an account on Ubuntu.
Ubuntu uses accounts to know **who you are** and **what you can do**.

Each user has:

* A **username** (like "toan" or "duy").
* A **home folder** (where your personal files are stored).
* A set of **permissions** (what you are allowed to do).

---

## 2. Why Do We Need Users?

Imagine a family computer:

* Toan has his own account.
* Dad has his account.
* Mom has hers.

Each person can:

* Keep private files (home folder).
* Set their own wallpaper and settings.
* Avoid breaking each other‚Äôs files.

Users also keep the system safe:

* Regular users can‚Äôt damage the system.
* Only the **administrator (root)** can install or remove software.

---

## 3. Types of Users

1. **Root User**

   * The most powerful account (like a ‚Äúsuperuser‚Äù).
   * Can change any file, install software, and control the whole system.
   * Usually hidden for safety.

2. **Regular Users**

   * Normal accounts for everyday use.
   * Can create files, change their own settings, and use programs.
   * Need permission to do system changes.

3. **System Users**

   * Invisible accounts that Ubuntu creates for services (like web servers or databases).
   * You usually don‚Äôt log into them.

---

## 4. The Home Directory

Every user has a **home folder**:

* Located at `/home/username`
* Example:

  * Toan‚Äôs files ‚Üí `/home/toan`
  * Dad‚Äôs files ‚Üí `/home/duy`

This is where you keep documents, pictures, and downloads.
Ubuntu protects your folder so other users cannot read or change it without permission.

---

## 5. Switching Users

On Ubuntu Desktop:

* You can switch users from the login screen.
* Or click User Menu ‚Üí ‚ÄúSwitch User‚Äù.

On the command line:

```bash
su - username
```

(`su` means "switch user").

To return, type:

```bash
exit
```

---

## 6. Sudo: Superuser for a Moment

Instead of logging in as the root user, Ubuntu lets regular users temporarily act like root with `sudo`.

Example:

```bash
sudo apt update
```

* `sudo` = ‚Äúsuperuser do‚Äù
* It will ask for your password.
* After that, the command runs as root.

This keeps the system safe because you only have root powers when necessary.

---

## 7. Creating and Managing Users

On the command line:

* **Create a new user:**

  ```bash
  sudo adduser newusername
  ```

* **Delete a user:**

  ```bash
  sudo deluser username
  ```

* **See all users:**

  ```bash
  cat /etc/passwd
  ```

## 8. Practice Tasks

1. Find your username with:

   ```bash
   whoami
   ```

2. Find your home folder with:

   ```bash
   echo $HOME
   ```

3. Use `sudo ls /root` ‚Üí It should only work with `sudo`.

4. Try to create a new test user:

   ```bash
   sudo adduser testuser
   ```

5. Switch to that user:

   ```bash
   su - testuser
   ```

---

## 9. Summary

* Users are accounts on Ubuntu that control **access** and **permissions**.
* Each user has a home directory.
* The root user is the superuser.
* `sudo` lets you run commands as root safely.
* You can create, switch, and manage users from the terminal.

# Exercises

Create a directory to store your answers:

```
mkdir ~/work/learn
mkdir ~/work/learn/answer
```

From now on, save your answers in this directory, and just send me the filename through email.


## Part A ‚Äì Simple Questions

1. What is the difference between the **root user** and a **regular user**?
2. What does the `sudo` command do?
3. Why do you think Ubuntu hides the root account by default?
4. What does the `su` command do?
5. Explain the syntax of the `su` command.

---

## Part B ‚Äì Practice in the Terminal

1. **Find your username**

   ```bash
   whoami
   ```

2. **Find your home folder**

   ```bash
   echo $HOME
   ```

3. **List all users on the system**

   ```bash
   cat /etc/passwd
   ```

   üëâ Look at the first word on each line ‚Äì that‚Äôs the username.

4. **Create a new user named `practice1`**

   ```bash
   sudo adduser practice1
   ```

5. **Switch to that user**

   ```bash
   su - practice1
   ```

   Then type `whoami` to confirm.

6. **Go back to your original user**

   ```bash
   exit
   ```

7. **Try a root-only folder**

   ```bash
   ls /root
   ```

   üëâ Notice it says *Permission denied*.
   Now try:

   ```bash
   sudo ls /root
   ```

## Part C ‚Äì Challenge Tasks

1. Create another user called `practice2`.
2. Switch to `practice2` and create a file in their home folder:

   ```bash
   touch t1.txt
   ```
3. Switch back to your original account.
   Try to open that file from your home folder. Can you? Why or why not?
4. When you are in your original account, copy `/etc/passwd` to `/home/practice2/`.
5. When you are in `practice2` account, copy `~/passwd` to `/home/toan/work/tmp`.
6. Remove the test users when done:

   ```bash
   sudo deluser practice1
   sudo deluser practice2
   ```
7. Remove **home folder** of `practice1` and `practice2` users.
8. What is the **home folder** of the `root` user?
9. Copy `/etc/passwd` to the `root` user's **home folder**.
10. Take notes for this lesson into `~/work/note/user-on-ubuntu.txt`.
