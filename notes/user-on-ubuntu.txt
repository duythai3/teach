Users on Ubuntu Notes

1. What is a User?

	A user is like an account on Ubuntu
	A user has a username, a home folder, and a set of permissions

2. Why Do We Need Users?

	Users allow a person to

		Keep private files
		Set their own wallpaper and settings
		Avoid breaking each other's files
	Regular users can't damage the system
	Only the root can install or remove software

3. Types of Users

	Root User
		
		The most powerful account
		Has total control over system
		Hidden for safety
	Regular Users

		Normal accounts for everyday use
		Can control their own account
		Needs perms to change system

	System Users
		
		Invisible accounts used for services
		DO NOT LOG INTO THEM

4. The Home Directory

	~ or /home/username

5. Switching Users

	On Ubuntu Desktop

		Switch users from the login screen
		Click Menu to "Switch User"
	On the command line
		"su(switch user) [-] [username]"

6. Sudo: Superuser for a Moment

	sudo = "superuser do"
	After sudo, it will ask for password then runs command as root
