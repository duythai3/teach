# Tab Completion on Ubuntu
### What is Tab Completion?
When you type a command in a terminal, sometimes pressing **Tab** will fill in the rest of the word for you.<br>
This is called **tab completion**.<br>
It saves time, avoid typos, and help you discover commands or files without remembering the full names.
### Trying Basic Completion
Open the terminal and type:
```
ech
```
Now press **Tab**<br>
You should see it complete to:
```
echo
```
because `echo` is a command on Ubuntu.
