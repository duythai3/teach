# Learning the cp Command in Ubuntu
### 1. What is `cp`?
The cp command in Linux/Ubuntu is used to copy files and directories.
Think of it like "copy & paste" on Windows or macOS, but in the terminal.
### 2. Basic Syntax
```
cp [options] source destination
```
- **source** = the file or folder you want to copy

- **destination** = where you want to put the copy

- **options** = extra instructions (like "copy folders" or "ask before overwriting")
