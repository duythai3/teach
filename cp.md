# Learning the cp Command in Ubuntu
### 1. What is `cp`?
The cp command in Linux/Ubuntu is used to copy files and directories.
Think of it like "copy & paste" on Windows or macOS, but in the terminal.
### 2. Basic Syntax
```
cp [options] source destination
```
- **source** = the file or folder you want to copy

- **destination** = where you want to put the copy

- **options** = extra instructions (like "copy folders" or "ask before overwriting")
### 3. Simple Examples
#### a) Copy a file in the same folder
```
cp file1.txt file1_copy.txt
```
This creates a copy named `file1_copy.txt`.
#### b) Copy a file into another folder
```
cp file1.txt /home/toan/Documents/
```
This copies `file1.txt` into the`Documents` folder.
